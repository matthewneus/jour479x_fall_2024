Despite teams placing most of their total shots on goal, this doesn't lead to those same teams generating a lot of scoring. As Prairie View had the highest shots on goal percentage at 70 percent, they only scored 11 times.

The best way to judge an attack would be to look at its goals scored per shots instead of how many shots on goal a team has accumulated. Chicago State makes the most of its total shot attempts, scoring 21 times on 89 shots. This shows which teams are more clinical with their goal-scoring opportunities.
