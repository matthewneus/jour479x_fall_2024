College soccer rosters in Division I are internationally diverse. Over 20 percent of players are from continents outside of North America, and over 30 percent are from countries beyond the United States. These players play collegiate soccer to earn an education while trying to start a professional soccer career.

1,244 Division I soccer players hail from Europe. England and Germany are the two most well-represented countries, sending 202 and 186 players to collegiate soccer programs, respectively.

A majority of the European influence in Division I college soccer hails from western parts of the continent, like England, Germany, France and Spain. The further east you move across Europe, like toward the Balkan region, fewer players are tabbed by Division I programs.

Serbia brings the most players out of any Balkan country with 15.

With more than 1,200 players coming from Europe, a majority of those to make the journey across the pond play in defensive-minded positions.

England and Germany, the two countries that make up most of the European presence on collegiate soccer rosters, account for the most defenders with 80 coming from Germany and 69 coming from England.

Midfielders also frequently hail from England and Germany, alongside Spain. There are 164 midfielders at Division I programs across the three European countries.

Europe dominates the defensive positions on rosters, but Africa, Asia and South America make up for a plethora of midfielders. From those three continents, 159 midfielders appear in collegiate soccer.

Forwards are more common to come from Africa or Asia, with 45 and 35 attackers, respectively.

Many teams opt to look for goalkeepers with height, as they will be in between the posts and crossbar and tasked with diving to stop shots fired their way. For goalies that had heights listed on college rosters, which was 756, 675 were 6' 0" or taller. This strategy of electing to recruit taller players is shared when teams assemble their back lines. There are 1,119 defenders on Division I rosters that are 6' 0" or taller, compared to only 650 that are shorter than the six feet threshold.

For example, Maryland men's soccer's back four in 2024 were all European, with two Germans and one player from Norway and Denmark. Its goalie also hailed from Germany. The Terps' two center backs, Bjarne Thiesen and William Kulvik, stand at 6' 5" and 6' 1", respectively, while goalie Laurin Mack was recorded as 6' 1" tall.

Reserve defenders Jace Clark, Brian St. Martin and Mack DeVries, who all made appearances for Maryland this campaign, are taller than six feet tall. Backup goalie Hudson Blatteis is 6' 4".
